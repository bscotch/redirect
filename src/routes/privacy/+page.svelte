<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
	Absolutely no data is sent from this site to any remote server, ours or otherwise. That said, it's
	pretty likely that our web host (currently GitHub Pages) logs some data about your visit, like
	your IP address and diagnostic details, but they do not have access to any data you enter on the
	page.
</p>

<p>
	For this service to work, the URL you visit contains the link that you're trying to redirect to.
	Therefore anything that knows about the URLs you visit (your browser history, your browser
	extensions, your ISP, etc) can potentially see the URL you're trying to visit. Just normal
	internet stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Any data entered into forms on this site may be stored locally to add functionality, but won't go
	anywhere else. If you are using the forms to generate redirect URLs, then once those URLs are
	visited they'll be exposed to the same privacy concerns as any other URL you visit.
</p>

<p>
	Which is all to say: we're very intentionally not logging anything about you so this is a fairly
	private service, but regular internet stuff still applies.
</p>
